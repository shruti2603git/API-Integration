In the weather app, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and useful webpage. HTML provided the structure, including input boxes for city names and sections to display details like temperature(...degree Celsius) and weather(clear sky/overcast cloud). CSS was used to style the page for a clean and responsive design like rectangular box and blue button. JavaScript handled user input, fetched real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and updated the page dynamically after clicking the blue button. The api key is used to process API responses, and error handling(try and catch) ensured the app could manage invalid inputs. After completing the app, I uploaded it to GitHub to store and share my project.I have also shared the output of my project below to give the idea of how the project work like.
